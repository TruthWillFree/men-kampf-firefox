# Men-Kampf - Word Replacer
A jokey add-on for firefox that replaces words for amusing results.

The xpi-file can be downloaded here:
https://github.com/Alcesmire/men-kampf-firefox/raw/master/MenKampf.xpi

Original description:
> Replaces radfem rethoric with nazi-friendly alternatives. Just for fun.
> The add-on is inspired by the chrome extension "man kampf", but the word pairs used are different.

This was taken down from Mozilla's servers (without any mention of any violations of ToS or guidelines) and there were an article written about it. On that topic (my comment on the article):

>Despite what you may think, it's intended as nothing more than a crude joke. I saw people playing around with the chrome extension, and was a bit bummed down when I couldn't play around with it in firefox. So I forked off one of the popular "cloud-to-butt" extensions and made a version for myself (with pretty good and hilarious results, looking at your wiki image).

>Like I said, it's just a jokey extension that pokes fun at the fact that a lot of text is similar, spare from some key words. Change some of those keywords, and you can get a whole different result (in this case a bit of a polar opposite). It might not suit your style of humor, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be allowed to exist.

>By the way, "Add-ons that make changes to web content in ways that are non-obvious or difficult to trace by their users" really doesn't fit here. The add-on only affects the people who install it, and they know exactly what the plugin does. So it's neither making non-obvious changes, nor is it difficult to trace (the source is GPL'ed for easy inspection).

>I'm curious why they decided to pull it, considering no violation of specific rules or guidelines were mentioned in their message to me. I've asked for clarifications, and I'm quite curious to see the answer.

>Edit:
>Regarding "replaces neo-nazi rethoric [sic] with nazi friendly alternatives", the choice of words there was also part of the joke. I could have written "replaces Aryan buzzwords with nazi terminology", but that really haven't got the same ring to it.
